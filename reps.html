				<h3>Angel Chimuzu</h3>
				<p>When I heard about the opportunity to be student representative I felt compelled to
apply. My motives on taking on this role are quite simple; creating an environment for my
peers where their voices feel heard and to also improve my own personal skills of
becoming more confident in my abilities. I do have experience in representing students
and people in general, which I believe makes me suitable for the role. <p>In secondary
school I was an antibullying ambassador which came with the responsibilities of making
sure students voices were heard in order to improve their school experience and mental
wellbeing, which as student representative is what I would like to continue. </p><P>In addition,
Ive also had experience in working in collaborative environments for instance,
participating in a law moot has enhanced my communication skills and ability to become
more attentive to various ideas and then translate them in a public setting/ those of
higher authority. Despite this, I do desire to improve and maintain skills such as being
flexible and coming up with various ways of resolving student bodies inquiries within the
course which are what this role requires.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6">
				<h3>Paisley Veidman</h3>
				<p>My motivations for this role are to make sure that other students in the course feel like
their voices are heard and have someone to talk to. I am very approachable and that will
encourage others to come up to me with any questions about psychology and I will help
them out as much as I can.</p><p>Everyone will feel like they will be recognised and listened to. That’s what is motivating me to be part of this role.</p>
<p>I meet the requirements of this role because I can summarise group issues into
actionable goals. I was a corporal in the air cadets and part of that role was to
summarise groups into actionable goals. I work constructively with others to respond to developing situations.
I’m very willing to engage and regularly update.</p>

				<h3>Level C Reps</h3>

				<h3>Melissa Barrett</h3>
				<p>I am eager to become a Student Representative because I believe in ensuring the course is as
beneficial as possible. I’d love to foster a strong connection between students and staff,
ensuring the course runs effectively for all. This opportunity excites me because it will help
me feel more engaged with the course—how it runs, the staff, students, and the module
structure.</p>
<p>My goal is to represent my peers by actively listening to their feedback, summarizing their
concerns, and translating them into actionable goals that benefit both students and lecturers. I
am particularly interested in ensuring the course is tailored to students&#39; needs, allowing them
to learn in an engaging way while giving staff feedback on teaching methods. By facilitating
regular communication through virtual platforms, I will ensure students stay engaged and
staff feel their methods are resonating.</p>
<p>I believe I can contribute by collaborating constructively with other representatives, thinking
creatively to develop innovative solutions, and making sure our work positively impacts
student experiences. I am keen to engage in feedback processes for services like career-
focused groups, which are crucial for students. Ultimately, I want to be part of the process
that improves the course for current and future students.</p>

				<h3>Hayden Elliott</h3>
				<p>I am a Level-C Psychology student at Hope looking to aid and ease other students during
their studies here. I firmly believe that anything is possible if you put your mind to it, you
just need the right environment and mindset which is what I’m looking to provide to every
student studying Psychology here.</p>
<p>To ensure that students are satisfied with and enjoy their learning inside and outside of
University, I will be consistently attentive to the student’s needs through whatever means
necessary, making sure to take everyone’s thoughts into account and understanding them
thoroughly to a point where I can accurately represent their thoughts.</p>
<p>I will dedicate much of my time to listening and gathering the thoughts of students as I am
very passionate about the cause, however, I will make sure that there is not too much input
as opposed to output. I want to make a change for the benefit of the students that is
tangible and practical rather than purely listening to thoughts.
There is potential within everyone to achieve great feats during their time here and in the
future, so I want to realise that potential through working together with the Student Voice
committee.</p>

			<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6" >
				<h3>Mia Calder</h3>
				<p>My motivations for becoming a Student Representative focus on aiding the growth of a thriving
community of study. One of the things I enjoy about Liverpool Hope is the focus on student
voice, satisfaction, and improvement. Within a Student Representative role I would strengthen
that bridge between staff, course and student. Ensuring this by providing an approachable way
for students to voice their concerns, and I would raise them with an aim to quickly ensure they
are fixed. Being Autistic myself, I would love to give more neurodivergent representation into
student representative teams. The disability support at Hope is amazing, but I would love to see
that explored into the subjects I study.
I am dedicated to whatever work I am given, and despite having challenges during first year with
Psychology, I would love to show first-years that you can and will succeed, and asking for help is
not detrimental to your progress. I would be so grateful for this opportunity to help improve one of
my favourite fields of study, and to grow and develop within the student body. I think this position
would be beneficial to my own self-growth, through the experience gained and skills learnt
through the training provided.</p>

				<h3>Steph Todd </h3>
				<p>I was student rep. for Level C last year, and I found the role to be very rewarding and interesting.
Getting to know some of the other students and being the voice of their compliments and
concerns was an enjoyable part of my first-year experience, and I am keen to expand on this in
my second year.</p>
<p>Being able to get to know some of the tutors/lecturers a little better has also been a really good
experience for me. As a mature student, I don’t tend to mix as much with the younger, more
‘typical’ student, so being able to get to know more people from within this role has helped me
become a more confident and more outspoken and outgoing student.
I feel that this role will help both myself (and my studies) and my fellow students, and I will be
able to do more to be able to improve student life for us all, even if just in a small way. </p>

				<h3>Jamie Sharp</h3>
				<p>Having served as a student voice for two years, I believe I bring a valuable perspective to the
SVC as an effective mediator between students and faculty. My experience has allowed me to
develop strong communication skills and a mature approach to resolving issues. I am fully aware
of the expectations placed on the SVC and have witnessed first-hand how discussions can lead
to meaningful action. I am eager to continue supporting the School of Psychology in any way I
can.<p>
This past summer, I was fortunate enough to receive a summer scholarship, which was a truly
transformative experience. It provided me with the opportunity to explore how psychology can be
used to promote student/faculty relations, even outside of term time. This experience deepened
my understanding of how our discipline can create lasting impact, and it is this attitude and
dedication that I want to bring forward in my continued role with the SVC.</p>

				<h3>Alona Sverchkova</h3>
				<p>As an international student, I understand the unique challenges we face and the
importance of building a supportive community. I want to become a Student
Representative to help others overcome any possible obstacles. I’m committed to
listening to my peers and summarizing our concerns into clear goals for positive
change.<p>
As an H-level student, through many group projects and cultural exchanges, I have
developed teamwork skills that will help me work effectively with others to find
solutions. My creative thinking and understanding of cultural differences help me
approach problems in new ways and come up with innovative ideas. Also, I might
add that I speak Polish, Russian and Ukrainian, which allows me to support and
connect with a diverse range of students and ensure they feel more comfortable and
confident.</p>
<p>I look forward to participating in feedback processes for services like career support.
By advocating for my fellow students and engaging in open conversations, I hope to
create a comfortable environment where everyone feels valued, heard and
supported. It is truly exciting to be part of a team, which can enhance student
experience and build a strong community. I’m excited about the chance to contribute
to this role and support other students in their journey.</p>

				<h3>Yayan Zou</h3>
				<p>I am currently studying for an MSc in Psychology, and I am highly motivated to serve as a
mediator between students and staff. As an international student, I understand the importance of
effective communication and bridging gaps in understanding, both in academic and social
settings.</p>
<p>
As one of the organisers of the Liverpool Autism Hub, a quarterly event aimed at connecting
individuals interested in autism, I have gained valuable experience in gathering feedback and
translating it into actionable insights. This role has developed my ability to listen carefully and
respectfully, synthesise participant input, and transform it into feasible research ideas. I plan to
apply these skills by holding regular post-class discussions with my classmates, and gather their
feedback on our course, and further invite them to submit their thoughts via email. I will
categorise and synthesise their input into concise reports to ensure that individual
concerns—such as academic, mental health, or financial issues—are addressed through
appropriate resources.</p>
 
<p>I am eager to further develop my skills, particularly in areas like managing virtual platforms for
student feedback and integrating creativity into the feedback process. I am committed to
receiving training and working collaboratively to enhance the student experience at Hope
University.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6">
				<h3>Austin Edathinakam</h3>
				<p>My motivation to apply for the Student Representative role comes from a past
experience in my undergraduate program. Our class representative failed to address
important issues, which nearly caused a classmate to fail due to personal problems.
From that day, I realized the importance of being proactive and decided I wanted to
assist others, no matter how small their issues might seem.</p>
<p>I believe effective student representation happens when students feel safe to seek help.
My experience as a group leader in social work taught me the value of conflict resolution
and finding common ground among team members. I aim to create an inclusive
environment where everyone’s voice matters. As an international student, I am eager to
learn more about cultural exchange and how to engage with diverse perspectives. I will
actively listen to my peers, encouraging them to share their concerns. For instance, I
often share my own experiences to help others feel comfortable opening up.</p>
<p>I am particularly interested in increasing participation in extracurricular activities, as I
believe they enhance our college experience. I understand the importance of feedback
in building a supportive community, and I am committed to representing my fellow
students effectively.</p>
